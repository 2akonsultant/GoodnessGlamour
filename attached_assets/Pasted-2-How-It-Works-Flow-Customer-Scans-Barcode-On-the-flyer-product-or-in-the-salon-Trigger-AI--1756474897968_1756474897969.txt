2️⃣ How It Works: Flow

Customer Scans Barcode

On the flyer, product, or in the salon.

Trigger AI Interaction

WebRTC / VoIP call or chat pop-up launches AI.

AI Converses with Customer

Example:

Customer: "I want a hair treatment and spa."  
AI: "We have keratin treatment, Olaplex repair, and scalp detox packages. Which one interests you?"


Book Service

AI collects details and schedules the appointment in the salon management system.

Follow-up

AI can send confirmation via SMS/WhatsApp/email and recommend future services.

3️⃣ Recommended Tech Stack
Component	Options / Technologies
Frontend	ReactJS / Next.js for interactive web interface
Barcode Scanning	jsQR, QuaggaJS, or native camera API for web
AI Voice Agent	OpenAI GPT-5 API for text understanding + ElevenLabs / Google Text-to-Speech + WebRTC for live voice
Backend	Node.js + Express, or Python Flask/FastAPI
Database	PostgreSQL / MongoDB to store services, bookings, and customer data
Booking Integration	Google Calendar API, Calendly API, or custom booking system
Analytics	Google Analytics + custom dashboard using Chart.js or Recharts
Hosting	Vercel / AWS Amplify for frontend, AWS Lambda / EC2 for backend
4️⃣ Website Structure & AI Integration

Homepage

Hero section with QR scan prompt → “Scan QR & Speak to AI Agent”

Services preview (Hair, Skin, Nails, Spa, Makeup)

Services Page

Each service has photo, description, price

Option: "Ask AI about this service"

AI Interaction Panel

Chatbox / Voicebox UI

AI responds in natural language about services, availability, and packages

Option to book or ask for more details

Booking Page

AI-assisted booking flow

Customer confirms date & time, receives confirmation

Admin Dashboard

Track interactions and bookings

Update services & prices dynamically

5️⃣ AI Voice Interaction Example
AI: "Hello! Welcome to Glow & Grace Salon. Which service are you interested in today?"  
Customer: "Hair coloring and spa."  
AI: "We have balayage, ombre, root touch-up, and scalp detox. Do you want to book a session now or learn more?"  
Customer: "Book a balayage session."  
AI: "Perfect! Please select your preferred date and time."  

6️⃣ Implementation Tips

Barcode to AI Trigger: Use a dynamic QR code that links to a unique URL /ai?customerID=123 which opens the AI agent.

Voice vs Chat: Start with chat AI (simpler), then integrate WebRTC voice.

AI Knowledge Base: Include all salon services, FAQs, and packages in GPT’s context so it can answer accurately.

Mobile-First Design: Most users will scan QR codes from phones.

Compliance: Make sure booking & customer data handling complies with privacy laws (e.g., GDPR or Indian IT rules).

7️⃣ Bonus Features to Consider

Loyalty Program: AI can recognize customer ID from QR and offer personalized discounts.

Upselling: AI suggests complementary services (e.g., manicure with pedicure, or hair spa with haircut).

Follow-up: Automated reminders via WhatsApp / SMS.

💡 Best Approach for MVP (Minimum Viable Product):

Build the React web page with QR scanner and AI chat window.

Integrate GPT-5 API for service Q&A.

Connect to a simple booking backend (Google Calendar API).

Test with small set of services first.

Gradually add voice integration and full admin dashboard.

If you want, I can create a full project plan with tech stack diagram and sample React code for the AI-powered salon website that includes QR scanning + AI agent + booking flow—basically a ready-to-implement blueprint.
